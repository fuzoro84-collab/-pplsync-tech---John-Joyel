# DAsh — Full Stack Notes Application

DAsh is a simple and clean note-taking application built as part of a full-stack assignment.  
The goal was to build a working system using:

**Next.js · Tailwind CSS · FastAPI · Python · MongoDB · Docker**

This project includes user authentication (JWT), a responsive UI, and fully working CRUD APIs for notes.

#Project Overview

DAsh lets a user:

- Sign up and log in using JWT authentication  
- Create, edit, and delete notes  
- View all notes in a clean dashboard  
- Run everything locally using Docker  
- Use a Notion-inspired UI with Tailwind and motion effects  
- Interact with an async FastAPI backend + MongoDB database  

The entire application is containerized for easy setup.
